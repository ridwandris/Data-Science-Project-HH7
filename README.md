# Data-Science-Project-HH7

## Problem Statement:
Our motivation behind this project stems from the sharp rise in housing prices and the fact that buying a home is increasingly only possible through loans, we were motivated to explore how housing costs have changed over time in Germany. We aim to analyze and forecast the development of owner-occupied housing price indices in Germany from 2010 to 2024 using time series models and economic indicators. As young adults, this is also a personal concern, as affording property has become a growing challenge for our generation.
We want to understand the factors driving these price changes and provide insights into future trends, which could be valuable for potential homeowners, investors, and policymakers.
